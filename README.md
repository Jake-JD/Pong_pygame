This is the pong game made in python using pygame.

The controls are the 'w' and 's' key for the left paddle and the up and down keys for the right paddle.

Everytime someone hits the ball it will slightly increase in speed until someone scores, which it then resets back to it's default value of 5. You can watch this number go up in the terminal

The first player to 5 wins as a default but you can change this by going to the main() function and changing 'END_SCORE = 5' to whatever number you want.

The game will automatically reset after 3 seconds, once someone wins.
